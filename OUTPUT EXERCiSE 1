I woke up early in the morning to pray and start my morning routine

I went for a morning walk with my friends and having breakfast together

Me and my friends attend the online classes and help each other with the tasks

After finish the classes, i relaxed my mind by watching my favorite movies or animes

I usually had a quick nap around one or two hours to energized myself 

In the evening, I went for a jog or a walk while enjoying the beautiful scenery

I went back and had a shower and pray

I had my dinner before I start to do my works and assignment

I did my works and ask for help when i cannot understand

After finished my work or if I am too tired, I went to sleep
